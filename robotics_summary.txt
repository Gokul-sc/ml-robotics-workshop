# Robotics 

### Q) What are the key components of a robot?  
Key components of a robot include:  
1. **Manipulator (Arm) Mechanism**  
2. **Locomotion Mechanism** (e.g., rovers, etc.)  
3. **Navigation and Mapping Systems**  
4. **Sensors**  

#### Explanation:  
- **Manipulator (Arm) Mechanism**:  
  The manipulator arm has several joints and transducers to convert human movements into electrical signals and then back into physical movements.  
  It is often used in places where it would be dangerous to send a human.  

- **Locomotion Mechanism**:  
  Locomotion is used to move the robot, such as rovers on Mars.  
  Example: Mars rovers collect sensory data, map locations, and decide where to move next.  

- **Navigation and Mapping Systems**:  
  After mapping the area, navigation systems enable the robot to use the mapped data to move intelligently.  

- **Sensors**:  
  Sensors provide critical data for mapping locations and help the robot understand its environment as well as internal states.

### Q) List three applications of robotics in the real world.  
1. **Hazardous Locations**:  
   Robots are used in environments that are dangerous for humans, such as disaster sites or deep-sea exploration.  

2. **Monotonous Jobs**:  
   Robots perform repetitive tasks, for example, in factories, where automation increases efficiency.  

3. **Surgical Fields**:  
   Robots assist in surgeries.  
   Example: Neuralink's robot, used to implant a chip in a personâ€™s brain.
