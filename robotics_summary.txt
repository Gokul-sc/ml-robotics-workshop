Q) Key componants of a robot?
Q) List three applications of robotics in real world.

Key Componants of a robot include,
1) Manipulator (Arm) Mechanism:
2) Locomotion Mechanism( example : Rovers ,etc..)
3) Navigation and Mapping Systems
4) Sensors 
--> manipulayor arm has several joints and transducers to convert 
the humsn's movement to electrical signals and then again convert back and 
move the arm to perform a task. It is used in a place where it would be
dangerous to send a human.

-->Locomotion Mechanism is used used (for example) by rovers.
Mars rover collects sensory data and and then maps the location and decides where
to go.

-->Navigation is the next step of locomotion. After locating and mapping the
area, the rover needs to navigate. It uses the mapped data to do that
 
--> Sensors play an important role. they provide the data required
to map the location. And they also help the robot understand
it's environment and also internal things.

THREE APPLICATIONS OF ROBOTICS IN LIFE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

They are used in hazardous locations. 

They are used in monotonous jobs. For example , in factories.

Robots are also used in surgical fields. There are several surgical
robots which help doctors.
for example , the neuralink robot to plant the neuralink chip in a person's
brain.
