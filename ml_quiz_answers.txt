QUIZ
1) What is supervised learning with one example
2) Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
3) How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?

---> Supervised learning is where, we try to learn the function
with the given input and target values.
we fit the model with the xi (input) and yi(target/output)
The model tries find the relations using the functions.

There are two types in Supervised learning
classification
regression

Classification is a discreate model. It has the outputs like(cat , dog ) etc
|___> has two types.
1) binary / two class
2) multi class

----> Regression is used for continnuous values.
like a range of values.
for example predicting the temperatur / house prices.

2) ----> Supervised learning is dont by fitting the input and the target
values. Unsupervised does not have the req target values.
It identifies the relation based on the given features.
THE FUNCTION IS NOT GIVEN. THE MODEL HAS TO IDENTIFY THE relation

3) ----->In supervised learning , the model is trained on labelled
data. In reinforcement the agents learn by interacting with the environment
and recieve feedback in the form of points.
