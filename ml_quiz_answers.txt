# QUIZ

### 1. What is supervised learning with one example?
Supervised learning is where we try to learn the function with the given input and target values.  
We fit the model with the `xi` (input) and `yi` (target/output).  
The model tries to find the relationships using the functions.

There are two types in supervised learning:  
1. **Classification**  
   - A discrete model with outputs like (cat, dog, etc.).  
   - **Types**:
     - Binary / Two-class 
     - Multi-class  

2. **Regression**  
   - Used for continuous values, like a range of values.  
   - Example: Predicting the temperature or house prices.

### 2. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- **Supervised Learning**: Done by fitting the input and target values.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Does not require target values.  
  - It identifies relationships based on the given features.  
  - **Key Difference**: The function is not provided in unsupervised learning; the model has to identify the relationships.

### 3. How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?
- In **supervised learning**, the model is trained on labeled data.  
- In **reinforcement learning**, agents learn by interacting with the environment and receive feedback in the form of points.
