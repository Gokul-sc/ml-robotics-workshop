# Machine Learning for Robotics Workshop

Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Robotics** workshop! This self-paced program will guide you through 10 exciting levels where you will learn to apply machine learning techniques to robotics. Complete all levels and a mini-project to earn your certificate.

---

## **Workshop Overview**

### **What You Will Learn**
- Foundational concepts of robotics and machine learning (ML).
- Hands-on experience with tools like Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and ROS.
- Practical applications like computer vision, reinforcement learning, and SLAM.
- Building an end-to-end robot simulation integrating ML techniques.

### **How It Works**
- The workshop is divided into **10 levels**, each hosted on its own GitHub folder.
- Each level contains:
  - A `README.md` with objectives, resources, and tasks.
  - Code templates and datasets (if applicable).
- Participants must complete the tasks and submit their solutions on GitHub.

### **Eligibility for Certification**
To earn your certificate:
1. Complete all 10 levels.
2. Submit a mini-project that integrates the skills learned.
3. Pass all submissions reviewed by mentors.

- All discussions, announcements, and Q&A will take place on our Discord server.
- Make sure to:
  - Check the `#announcements` channel for updates.
  - Use level-specific channels (e.g., `#level-1`, `#level-2`) for queries.

### **Step 2: Fork and Clone the Repository**
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-robotics-workshop.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the folder for your current level:
   ```bash
   cd ml-robotics-workshop/level-1
   ```

### **Step 3: Complete Each Level**
1. Read the objectives and tasks in the `README.md` file for the level.
2. Follow the provided resources to complete the tasks.
3. Submit your solutions as instructed in the level folder.

### **Step 4: Submit Your Work**
- Push your changes to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed Level X"
  git push origin main
  ```
- Share the link to your repository in the `#submissions` channel on Discord.
- Mentors will review your work and provide feedback.
